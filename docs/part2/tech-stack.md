# The Tech Stack: Tools of the Modern Marketer

Conversation marketing isn’t just a mindset — it’s a system.

To deliver real-time, personalised, omni-channel conversations, you need more than creative thinking. You need a tech stack that connects channels, automates intelligently, tracks interactions, and scales without losing the human touch.

This chapter outlines the essential layers of the modern conversation marketing stack — and how to choose tools that align with your goals, size, and stage.

---

## The Stack, Simplified

You can think of your tech stack in five connected layers:

1. **Engagement Channels** – where conversations happen  
2. **Orchestration Layer** – manages flow and logic  
3. **Content Layer** – delivers messages and media  
4. **Data Layer** – tracks behaviour and context  
5. **AI Layer** – enhances personalisation and automation

Let’s unpack each.

---

## 1. Engagement Channels

These are the touchpoints where conversations happen — think chat, email, messaging apps, voice assistants, or even in-product modals.

| Channel                 | Example Tools                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Live Chat / Website Chat | Intercom, Drift, Tidio           |
| Messaging Apps           | WhatsApp Business, Messenger API |
| Social DMs               | Sprout Social, Hootsuite Inbox   |
| Voice                   | Alexa Skills, Google Assistant    |
| In-App                  | OneSignal, Appcues                |

---

## 2. Orchestration Layer

This is your conversation engine — the logic layer that decides what happens next based on customer inputs, context, or AI triggers.

| Tool                      | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Landbot, Voiceflow        | No-code flow builders for bots and voice UX  |
| Dialogflow, Botpress      | NLP-driven conversation engines              |
| Salesforce Marketing Cloud | Multi-step journey automation                |
| Zapier, Make (Integromat) | Connect tools and trigger workflows          |

---

## 3. Content Layer

Here’s where your conversation-ready content lives: the copy, assets, templates, and dynamic responses.

| Tool / Platform        | Purpose                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Notion, Airtable       | Manage message blocks, FAQs, scripts      |
| CMSs like Contentful   | Structure reusable content for delivery   |
| ChatGPT / Claude       | Assist with copywriting and response variation |

Store it once, deliver it dynamically based on audience and intent.

---

## 4. Data Layer

This is the intelligence behind the interaction. It includes everything from user profiles and purchase history to behavioural insights and event triggers.

| Source                | Value Provided                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| CRM (e.g. HubSpot)    | Contact data, lifecycle stage             |
| Analytics (GA4, Amplitude) | Real-time behaviour, funnels           |
| CDPs (Segment, mParticle) | Unified customer profiles across channels |
| Surveys & Feedback    | Preferences, satisfaction, sentiment      |

Connect data to context — this is what makes conversations *feel* personal.

---

## 5. AI Layer

This is what elevates your stack from responsive to intelligent.

| AI Capability            | Example Tools / APIs                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Natural Language Understanding | OpenAI, Cohere, Microsoft Azure AI   |
| Personalisation / Prediction   | Adobe Sensei, Dynamic Yield          |
| Sentiment Analysis       | MonkeyLearn, IBM Watson, Lexalytics   |
| Generative AI for Copy   | ChatGPT, Jasper, Writer                |

You don’t need everything at once — start with tools that enhance one layer and grow from there.

## Real-World Example: Domino’s Pizza

> *Domino’s* uses an integrated tech stack to let customers order via chatbot, track orders in real time, get follow-up notifications, and access support across channels. It’s not about flashy AI — it’s about frictionless, connected service.

---

## Integration Is Everything

A brilliant chatbot with no access to your CRM is a dead end. A great piece of content that can’t be triggered by behaviour is wasted.

**The goal is not more tools — it’s smarter connections.**

Look for platforms with:

- Open APIs and webhooks  
- Native integrations with your current stack  
- Unified dashboards or data sync  
- Scalable pricing and modular add-ons

---

## What This Chapter Really Means

Tech won’t replace strategy — but without the right stack, strategy stays stuck in slides. The modern marketer’s edge comes from aligning tools with intent, data with dialogue, and content with context.

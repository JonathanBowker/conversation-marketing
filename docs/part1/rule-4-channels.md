# Rule #4: Be Where the Conversation Is

You can’t have a conversation if you’re not in the room.

In today’s landscape, customers don’t limit their interactions to one channel. They move fluidly — from your website to social media, from a WhatsApp message to a support chatbot, from a voice search to an AI assistant.

To earn their attention, your brand needs to be **present, available, and responsive** wherever those conversations are happening.

## The Myth of Channel Ownership

Many brands still operate as if they *own* the communication channel. Website content? That’s ours. Email campaigns? Controlled. But the truth is: **the customer owns the journey** — and they expect it to work on their terms.

You don’t choose the channel — your audience does.

!!! quote "The Golden Rule of Channel Strategy"
    Be present on the channels your customers use — not just the ones your team prefers to manage.

## How Channel Expectations Have Changed

| Channel                        | Then                               | Now                                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Website                       | Digital brochure                    | Conversational interface (chat, personalisation) |
| Email                         | Campaign blasts                     | Triggered, relevant, real-time follow-ups        |
| Social media                  | Broadcast marketing                 | Two-way dialogue and customer care               |
| Messaging apps (e.g. WhatsApp) | Rare or support-only                | Core to real-time brand engagement               |
| Voice and AI assistants       | Gimmick or novelty                  | Discovery, search, and decision tools            |
| Search                        | Page rankings                       | Summarised answers from AI-driven engines        |

## Mapping Your Channel Strategy

You don’t need to be everywhere — you need to be *strategic*.

### Step 1: Know where your audience hangs out

Use data from web analytics, customer surveys, social insights, and search trends to find out:

- Which platforms they use
- When they’re active
- What devices they prefer
- How they expect to interact

### Step 2: Match purpose to platform

Not every conversation belongs everywhere. A support issue might belong in a chatbot. A product education journey might need a video or interactive guide. A promotion might be best received in a short-form message or personalised push notification.

| Purpose            | Best-fit Channels                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Support            | Website chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger        |
| Product Discovery  | Instagram, YouTube, Google AI Overviews           |
| Retention/Nurture  | Email, SMS, app notifications                     |
| Feedback           | In-app surveys, social polls, chatbot follow-ups  |
| Sales/Conversion   | Conversational ads, live chat, product quizzes    |

## Real-World Example: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines

> ***KLM*** was one of the first major brands to fully integrate WhatsApp and Messenger into its customer experience. Users can receive boarding passes, ask questions, change flights — all within their preferred messaging app. No app download. No long waits. Just conversation, where the customer is already active.

---

## The Omni-Channel Reality

Being “multi-channel” means being on many platforms. Being **omni-channel** means those platforms work together.

That means:

- A conversation started in one channel can continue in another  
- The customer doesn’t have to repeat themselves  
- Context is carried through — tone, history, and next steps

The goal isn’t more channels — it’s *better coordination* between them.

## What This Rule Really Means

Go where the dialogue is happening. Be present in the moments that matter. And make sure your presence feels human, helpful, and joined-up.

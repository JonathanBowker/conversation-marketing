They want brands that listen, respond, and deliver value in the moment, not months later. Marketing has shifted from monologue to dialogue \u2014 and from messaging to meaning.</p> <p>This transformation isn\u2019t just about tone \u2014 it\u2019s structural.

These systems offer instant, curated responses \u2014 not lists of links \u2014 meaning brands must now optimise for visibility inside these AI-driven environments.

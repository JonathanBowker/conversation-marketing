# Glossary

A quick reference for the core terms used throughout *The New Rules of Conversation Marketing*.

---

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)  
The simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially software that can learn, reason, and respond. Used in marketing for automation, personalisation, and real-time engagement.

---

### Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)  
Optimising content to appear in AI-generated summaries and responses (e.g. ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews) rather than traditional search engine results pages (SERPs).

---

### API (Application Programming Interface)  
A set of tools and protocols that allows different systems to talk to each other. Enables integration across your marketing stack and conversational tools.

---

### Brando Schema  
A structured vocabulary (developed alongside this handbook) for defining your brand’s tone, voice, purpose, and guardrails in machine-readable form — so AI can represent your brand accurately.

---

### Chatbot  
A software application that simulates conversation with users via messaging interfaces, often powered by rules or AI.

---

### Conversational Advertising  
A format of advertising that invites users into a dialogue (via chat or messaging) rather than sending them to a static landing page.

---

### Conversational Design  
The practice of designing structured, natural, and useful interactions between humans and machines — typically in messaging apps, chatbots, or voice interfaces.

---

### Conversational Marketing  
A marketing approach focused on two-way dialogue with customers — using chat, messaging, voice, or other interactive formats — to build relationships in real time.

---

### Conversational Sales  
The use of chat-based or real-time dialogue (often assisted by AI) to guide leads from interest to purchase, replacing traditional forms and friction-heavy sales flows.

---

### CRM (Customer Relationship Management)  
A system or platform for managing a company’s interactions and relationships with current and potential customers.

---

### CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)  
A common metric used to measure how satisfied a customer is with a specific interaction or service experience.

---

### Customer Journey  
The complete sequence of touchpoints and interactions a person has with a brand — from first awareness through purchase, onboarding, and beyond.

---

### Intent  
What a user is trying to do when they engage — their goal, question, or purpose. Identifying intent is essential to delivering relevant conversations.

---

### LLM (Large Language Model)  
A type of AI trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like responses. Powers tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

---

### Live Persona  
A dynamic, AI-informed customer profile that updates in real time based on behaviour, preferences, and feedback — as opposed to a static persona.

---

### Messaging Platform  
Apps and systems that support direct messaging between users and brands — including WhatsApp, Messenger, SMS, and in-app chat.

---

### Microcopy  
Short pieces of text (e.g. buttons, labels, prompts) used in interfaces or conversation flows to guide users with clarity and tone.

---

### NLU (Natural Language Understanding)  
A subfield of AI that allows machines to interpret and process human language input (text or speech).

---

### Omni-Channel  
A seamless and integrated experience across multiple channels and devices — where customers can switch between touchpoints without losing context.

---

### Prompt  
A question or input used to trigger an AI response or guide the direction of a chatbot or generative model.

---

### ROI (Return on Investment)  
A measure of the value received relative to the cost of an initiative. In this handbook, we expand the concept to **Return on Interaction** — value created through conversation.

---

### Schema Markup  
Structured data added to your website content that helps search engines and AI systems understand your brand, products, and services more clearly.

---

### Sentiment Analysis  
The process of detecting emotion or tone (positive, negative, neutral) in text — often used in chat logs or social listening.

---

### Voice of the Brand  
The distinct tone, style, and language your brand uses in communication — designed to reflect personality, values, and positioning.

---

### Webhook  
A method for one system to send real-time data to another, often used to trigger automation or sync information between tools.

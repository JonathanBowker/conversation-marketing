# The New ROI: Measuring What Matters

You can’t manage what you don’t measure. But in conversation marketing, **what you measure matters even more**.

Clicks and impressions might tell you who saw your message — but they say nothing about how people felt, what they needed, or whether your brand made a real connection.

It’s time to move beyond vanity metrics and embrace a new definition of ROI: **Return on Interaction**.

## What’s Wrong with Traditional Marketing Metrics?

| Traditional Metric       | The Problem                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Impressions              | Doesn’t reflect engagement or interest      |
| Open rate (email)        | Doesn’t show depth or next action           |
| Bounce rate              | Lacks context — why did they leave?         |
| Form conversions         | Misses the value of partial or indirect intent |
| Lead volume              | Prioritises quantity over quality           |

In a conversation-driven world, **relationships beat reach**.

## A Better Lens: Return on Interaction

Return on Interaction (ROI 2.0) looks at the **value created through two-way engagement** — not just exposure.

Key questions to guide your measurement:

- Did the customer feel heard or helped?  
- Did they take meaningful action?  
- Did this conversation contribute to long-term loyalty or insight?

## What to Measure Instead

### 1. **Conversation Quality**
How effective and engaging was the interaction?

| Metric                    | How to Measure                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Response time             | Avg. time to first reply or resolution     |
| Completion rate           | % of conversations that reach an outcome  |
| Sentiment score           | Positive/neutral/negative tone detected   |
| Escalation rate           | % of conversations passed to a human      |

---

### 2. **Customer Impact**
How did the interaction affect behaviour, trust, or loyalty?

| Metric                          | Value Provided                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| CSAT/NPS                        | Immediate satisfaction or loyalty score        |
| Repeat engagement               | % of users who return to chat again            |
| Time to value (TTV)             | How quickly a user gets what they need         |
| Issue resolution rate           | % of conversations that solve the user's problem |

---

### 3. **Business Impact**
What outcomes did the conversation contribute to?

| Metric                        | Value to Business                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Lead-to-qualified conversion  | % of chats that lead to quality leads         |
| Conversation-to-sale ratio    | % of chats that end in a transaction          |
| LTV uplift from engaged users | Higher value of users who interacted          |
| Cost per resolved conversation| Operational efficiency via automation         |

## Real-World Example: Monzo Bank

> ***Monzo*** uses in-app chat to manage customer questions quickly, transparently, and with a strong human tone — even when powered by automation. They measure not just response time, but **customer trust**, **resolution accuracy**, and **re-engagement rate**.

Their takeaway: a helpful conversation today creates a loyal customer tomorrow.

!!! tip "Combine Qual + Quant"
    Use a mix of data and dialogue — don’t just look at dashboards. Review real conversations regularly to understand the *why* behind the numbers.

---

## Moving from Measurement to Insight

Don’t just report — learn.

- Which questions keep coming up?  
- Where do people drop off?  
- What’s your tone like under pressure?  
- Which agents or flows perform best?

Turn every data point into a design decision.

## What This Chapter Really Means

The new ROI isn’t about how loud your marketing is — it’s about how *useful*, *human*, and *effective* your conversations are. It’s about measuring relationships, not reach.

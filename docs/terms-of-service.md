In these terms, **Advanced Analytica Limited** is referred to as *“AA/we/our/us”*.  
The clients of AA are referred to as *“you/your”*. This includes anyone authorised to give instructions on your behalf.

## 2. Our Status

We are a limited liability company incorporated in England.

## 3. Entire Terms

These are the only terms that apply between us. They may only be changed if replaced in their entirety, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing.

If any term is held to be invalid, it shall be amended only as far as necessary to make it valid. If amendment is not possible, it shall be deleted. All other terms shall remain unaffected.

## 5. Charges

### 5.1 Fees

Our fees for this engagement are set out in the Schedule.  
Where a fixed or capped fee is offered, the scope of work will be specified and based on agreed assumptions. Where assumptions no longer apply, or for work outside of scope, or where no fixed fee is agreed, we charge based on time at our standard day rates. Rates are reviewed annually and may change with one month’s written notice.

### 5.2 Estimates

Any estimate provided is based on assumptions and is not a fee cap. Actual charges may exceed the estimate.

### 5.3 Disbursements

With your written consent, we may incur disbursements on your behalf. You are liable to reimburse us for these at cost. Where we engage third parties in our own name as part of our service, we may make a linked charge for our related work.

All prices are exclusive of VAT. VAT will be added at the prevailing UK rate, where applicable.

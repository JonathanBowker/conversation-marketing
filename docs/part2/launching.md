# Launching Your Conversation Engine

You’ve got the strategy, the flows, the content, and the tech stack — now it’s time to go live.

But launching a conversation marketing engine isn’t like launching a static campaign. It’s not a “set it and forget it” process. It’s a living system — designed to listen, adapt, and improve.

This chapter will guide you through a successful launch: from preparing your team to promoting your channels and refining your flows post-launch.

---

## 1. Set Clear Objectives

Before you deploy anything, define **what success looks like** — for both the business and the customer.

### Common launch goals:

- Reduce customer service response time  
- Increase lead qualification through automation  
- Drive more conversions from chat-based journeys  
- Improve onboarding or product adoption  
- Collect feedback and sentiment at scale  

Tie each goal to **measurable KPIs**, such as:

- Time to first response  
- Conversion rate from chat to action  
- NPS or CSAT improvements  
- Number of qualified leads or resolved issues  

---

## 2. Train the Humans Behind the Machines

Even the most advanced system needs people behind it.

- Ensure your customer-facing teams know how to **step in** when needed  
- Train your staff on **tone, escalation protocols, and expectations**  
- Align support, sales, and marketing on conversation purpose and scope  
- Create documentation and internal playbooks for common scenarios  

Remember: conversational marketing blends **automation and human empathy**. That’s the winning combo.

    Define your brand’s tone of voice, preferred greetings, fallback language, and escalation phrases — so everyone sounds like one consistent brand.

## 3. Promote the Conversation Entry Points

A great chatbot or message flow won’t help anyone if no one sees it.

Make sure your conversation channels are:

- **Visible**: Add them to menus, footers, banners, emails, and landing pages  
- **Inviting**: Use proactive messages to greet or guide visitors  
- **Contextual**: Trigger the right message based on page, behaviour, or timing  
- **Integrated**: Promote across your campaigns — "Have questions? Chat with us!"  

Think of them like store entrances — clean, obvious, and welcoming.

## 4. Monitor and Iterate Fast

You won’t get everything perfect on day one — and that’s okay.

### Track early signals:

- Drop-off points in flows  
- FAQ triggers that get repeated  
- Response speed or satisfaction ratings  
- Unusual queries or sentiment spikes  

### Use this data to:

- Rewrite confusing responses  
- Add missing branches or fallback logic  
- Train AI models with new examples  
- Escalate more efficiently  

**Weekly reviews in the first month are essential.**

## Real-World Example: ASOS Customer Assistant

> ***ASOS*** rolled out a customer support chatbot to manage high-volume queries. But its real strength was in iteration — within the first 90 days, they’d added 500+ new queries, shortened wait times, and integrated product discovery into the flow.

They didn’t launch a perfect bot. They launched a *learning* one.

---

## 5. Close the Loop

Don’t just collect data — act on it. Share insights with product teams, UX designers, and leadership.

Conversation data is one of your richest sources of:

- Customer language and sentiment  
- Objections and pain points  
- Opportunities to improve your offer  

Make it part of your continuous improvement process.

## What This Chapter Really Means

Launching your conversational engine is a milestone — but it’s not the finish line.

It’s the beginning of a new kind of relationship: one where your brand doesn’t just speak, but listens, adapts, and evolves — every day.

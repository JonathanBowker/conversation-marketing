# Conversation Engine Checklist

Use this checklist before launching (or relaunching) any major conversational experience. It’s grouped into four phases: Strategy, Build, Launch, and Optimise.

---

## Strategy & Planning

- [ ] Have you clearly defined the **primary goal** of the conversation?  
- [ ] Do you understand the **audience’s intent**, expectations, and language?  
- [ ] Is your **tone of voice** documented and consistent with your brand?  
- [ ] Have you mapped the **customer journey** around this flow or feature?  
- [ ] Is the flow aligned with **business objectives** and KPIs?

---

## Build & Design

- [ ] Have you drafted the **conversation flow** using a clear decision tree or map?  
- [ ] Are key messages **short, conversational, and action-oriented**?  
- [ ] Are **fallbacks** and **edge cases** defined and handled gracefully?  
- [ ] Are hand-offs to humans (support, sales, etc.) seamless and timely?  
- [ ] Is the experience **accessible** across devices and inclusive of different needs?  
- [ ] Is user data handled in a way that’s **secure and compliant**?

---

## Launch Readiness

- [ ] Has the experience been tested **across all entry points and devices**?  
- [ ] Have internal teams been **trained on escalation protocols** and tools?  
- [ ] Are **analytics and success metrics** configured (e.g. conversion, CSAT, resolution)?  
- [ ] Have you set up **tracking for drop-offs, sentiment, and unresolved queries**?  
- [ ] Is your system integrated with **CRM or support tools** if needed?  
- [ ] Do users know **how to exit or ask for help**?

---

## Optimisation & Feedback Loop

- [ ] Is there a **weekly or monthly review** process in place for conversation data?  
- [ ] Are **transcripts** or chat logs reviewed regularly for insight?  
- [ ] Is there a clear owner for making flow updates or bug fixes?  
- [ ] Are you collecting **qualitative feedback** from users or support teams?  
- [ ] Are you tracking **performance trends** and testing small changes regularly?  
- [ ] Have you documented **what’s working — and why**?

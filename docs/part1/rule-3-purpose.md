# Rule #3: Define Your Conversational Purpose

Not every conversation is created equal. Some are meant to inform. Others are meant to convert, support, or retain. Without a clear purpose, even the best-designed dialogue risks becoming noise.

Conversation marketing only works when it’s aligned with what your audience needs — **and what your business is trying to achieve**.

## Why Purpose Matters

A conversation without purpose is like a meeting without an agenda — it wastes time and rarely leads anywhere meaningful.

Defining your conversational purpose helps you:

- Design flows that feel intentional, not random  
- Set expectations for users and internal teams  
- Align messaging with customer journey stages  
- Choose the right KPIs and measure what matters

!!! tip "Purpose isn't always about conversion"
    Some of your most valuable conversations won't lead to an immediate sale — they’ll build trust, clarify doubts, or offer help. And that’s just as important.

## Common Conversational Objectives

Your conversational purpose should map directly to both user intent and business goals. Some examples:

| Purpose                        | Example Conversation or Flow                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Educate                       | Explaining a product feature or industry concept       |
| Convert                       | Guiding a user through product comparison to checkout  |
| Support                       | Answering post-purchase questions via chatbot          |
| Qualify                       | Pre-screening leads with interactive Q&A               |
| Retain / Re-engage            | Recommending new content or products to existing users |
| Learn                         | Asking users for feedback or preferences               |

## Define the Voice That Delivers It

Your purpose influences not just *what* you say, but *how* you say it. Each purpose comes with a different tone, format, and flow.

### Conversational tone by purpose:

| Purpose      | Suggested Tone         | Channel Fit                      |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Educate      | Helpful, patient        | Chatbot, blog, explainer video   |
| Convert      | Clear, concise, persuasive | Landing page, live chat, SMS     |
| Support      | Empathetic, calm        | Help desk, WhatsApp, web chat    |
| Retain       | Warm, friendly          | Email, app notifications         |
| Qualify      | Direct, respectful      | Messenger, chatbot, quiz         |

## Real-World Example: LEGO Gift Finder

> *LEGO* uses a chatbot during peak holiday periods to help shoppers find the perfect gift based on recipient, age, and budget. The purpose? Reduce friction, boost conversion — and make the process fun. The tone is playful but purposeful.

---

## How to Define Your Purpose

Start each conversation design with three simple questions:

1. **What is the user trying to do here?**  
   (E.g. learn, buy, decide, get help?)

2. **What does the business need from this interaction?**  
   (E.g. drive sales, reduce support load, gather data?)

3. **How should this feel to the customer?**  
   (Tone, pacing, language, expectations)

When your answers align, you’ve found your conversational sweet spot.

## What This Rule Really Means

Every conversation should have a reason to exist — and a reason to continue. Purpose brings focus. It turns automation into experience and intent into results.
